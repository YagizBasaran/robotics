## 🚀 **Overview**
This project showcases the development of a **robotic system for throwing a ring onto a pole with high precision**. The system is powered by the **Robotic library (`ry`)** (version 0.1.10) for simulation and control, and features:
- A **thrower robot** that calculates optimal trajectories and velocities to throw a ring.

This project demonstrates cutting-edge robotics concepts, including:
- 🎯 **Trajectory Optimization**
- 🤖 **Kinematics and Dynamics Simulation**
- 🛠️ **Object Tracking and Manipulation**


## ✨ **Features**
### **Thrower Robot**
- 📐 **Optimal Velocity Calculation**: Computes the throwing velocity using kinematic and dynamic constraints.
- 🌌 **Trajectory Simulation**: Models ring trajectories accounting for gravity and release parameters.
- 🔄 **Inversion Handling**: Manages trajectory flipping for complex *pole* placements.


## **❗Path Finding❗**
- First, grasp the ring optimally.
- Second, determine the most effective throwing motion (catapult-style over frisbee-style).
- Third, position the robot for accurate velocity execution.
- Lastly, decide the precise release point for optimal landing.

### **Simulation Environment**
- 🛠️ Built using the **[robotic](https://github.com/MarcToussaint/robotic/) library (`ry`)** by [Marc Toussaint](https://github.com/MarcToussaint). Thanks Marc!
- 🎥 **Visualization Support**: Displays trajectories and robot movements in real-time.

## 💡 **Key Highlights**
- A perfect demonstration of **real-time robotics simulation**.
- Integrates advanced algorithms like **trajectory optimization** for dynamic adaptability.
- **Modular and extensible** design for further enhancements and experimentation.

## 🏆 **Future Work**
- Enhance the vision system to include **machine learning-based tracking** for better ring trajectory estimation.
- Optimize RRT algorithms for faster and more efficient pathfinding.
- Add precision and computer vision to the system.
